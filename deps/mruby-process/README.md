mruby-process
=========

## install by mrbgems
 - add conf.gem line to `build_config.rb`
```ruby
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|

    # ... (snip) ...

    conf.gem :git => 'https://github.com/iij/mruby-process.git'
end
```

## Features

 - Process - fork kill pid ppid waitpid waitpid2
 - Process::Status - all methods but `&`, ``>>``
   - You can use ``Process::Stauts.new(pid, status)`` to set ``$?`` in
     your script or other mrbgems.
 - Kernel - $$ exit exit! fork sleep system


## Caveats

 - $? may not work correctly on the platform where ``pid_t`` is not ``int`` or
   ``MRB_INT_MAX`` is less than ``PID_MAX`` (or /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max).
